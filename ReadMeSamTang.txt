I have tried to get functionality to work from the start. Missing some elements of the badges as I haven't had coverage of the model and its schema. Would have liked to dive in futher but time was limited.

I added a pipe in order to get acsending and descending sorting of totalSaleProfits. From here I was able to do then find highest and lowest clients. 
I want to make this code slightly more intuitive, I would have liked to piped this information through a pipe in my typescirpt but couldn't remember the process in the given time frame.
In order to get product information I needed more information in data which I couldn't seem to locate or it wasn't provided.
I would have like to spend more time on the visual presentation but I ran out of time here, functionality is somewhat fucntional so some correct data is being displayed after selecting profits from the dropdown. Would like not to display anything until a selection is made as a next step.
User experience could be somewhat better with more use of space. Colour balancing the contents with some improved visuals.

The chart works with the data service, sales reporting. When sales reporting has fetched the data it runs through a data model and provides me with clients information: clientId, clientName and total sales income. This data I feed through my pipe to get its ascending/descending order from Total sales profit.
This I then feed to my HTML displaying lowest clinet  profits and highest sale profits. The ascending or descending button can then be clicked to display data differently. Limited on time but all I mangaged to get done for the afternoon.
